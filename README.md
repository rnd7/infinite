# Lux & Lucid Infinite
Electron Application written for a video installation in 2017. It is basically a infinite zoom realized programmatically. The App picks random images from the assets directory changes the colors a bit and animates them towards the viewer. You can change some parameters during runtime. The App features rudimentary projection mapping capabilities. It's a quick and dirty solution just for one show, so don't expect too much.

## Installation
You need node and npm installed on your machine. It should work on all platforms electron supports. I only tested in on a linux machine.

```
npm install
```

## Run

```
npm start
```

## Known issues
While images are loaded the animation might lag. This only happens, when a image is loaded for the first time.
